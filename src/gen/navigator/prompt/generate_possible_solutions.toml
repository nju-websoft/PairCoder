user="""You are given a coding problem:
{{description}}
Self-reflection on the problem:

Here are also explanations for public test cases:
{{ tests_explanations_str|trim }}
{%- endif %}

Provide up to {{max_num_of_possible_solutions}} possible solution plans to the problem.
Each solution plan should:
1.Have a descriptive name.
2.Outline the solution approach:
   - For simple problems (e.g., reversing a list), provide a concise solution (e.g., we can directly use list1[::-1] to do it.).
   - For complex problems (e.g., finding the shortest path in a graph), provide a problem-solving plan with high-level steps (e.g., we can use BFS to solve it. First, Initialize a queue with... Second, ...).
  If necessary, select an appropriate algorithm through problem analysis such as brute force, simulation, greedy, hash map, two pointers, DFS/BFS, stack/queue, DP, etc.
3.Ensure functional correctness by addressing all possible valid inputs and edge cases per problem description.

Your answer should be directly parsable as YAML. DO NOT output anything else.
The output must be a YAML object like this:
Example YAML output:
```yaml
possible_solutions:
  - name: |
      ...
    content: |
      ...
  - name: |
      ...
    content: |
      ...
  ...
```
Answer:
```yaml
